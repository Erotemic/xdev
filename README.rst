Xdev is an excellent developer tool for excellent developers.
It contains miscellaneous and/or interactive debugging tools.

This started as a project for myself to contain development related tools that
I wouldn't want to ship with a package itself (where as `ubelt
<https://github.com/Erotemic/ubelt>`_ contains the tools used in programs
themselves). I've polished it up over the years, and it's become a reasonably
useful package with tools I could see other's making use of.


This is the CLI:

.. code::

    usage: xdev [-h] [--version] {info,codeblock,sed,find,tree,pint,pyfile,pyversion,editfile,format_quotes,freshpyenv,docstubs,available_package_versions,dirstats} ...

Remarks
-------

Perhaps I should just use `ipdb` but I often just like to directly embed with
IPython whenever I want:


.. code:: python

    import xdev
    xdev.embed()


Or wherever I want whenever there is an exception.

.. code:: python

    import xdev
    with xdev.embed_on_exception:
        some_code()


I don't feel like I need  `ipdb <https://github.com/gotcha/ipdb>`_'s other features.


I also like to


.. code:: python

    def func(a=1, b=2, c=3):
        """
        Example:
            >>> from this.module import *  # import contextual namespace
            >>> import xinspect
            >>> globals().update(xinspect.get_func_kwargs(func))  # populates globals with default kwarg value
            >>> print(a + b + c)
            6
        """

But I know these things are a little dirty.

But these aren't production practices. These are development tricks and life
hacks to make working faster.


Also see ``xinspect`` for things like ``autogen_imports``


.. code:: python

    >>> import ubelt as ub
    >>> source = ub.codeblock(
    >>>     '''
    >>>     p = os.path.dirname(join('a', 'b'))
    >>>     glob.glob(p)
    >>>     ''')
    >>> # Generate a list of lines to fix the name errors
    >>> lines = autogen_imports(source=source)
    >>> print(lines)
    ['import glob', 'from os.path import join', 'import os']


The CLI
-------

The xdev CLI is getting kinda nice, although it is a bit of a hodgepodge of
functionality (much like this library).

.. code::

   pip install xdev
   xdev --help


It contains functionality that I generally use when developing on my setup, but
I often find lacking in the setup of others.

For instance the `tree <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(command)>`_ UNIX
command is amazing, but not everyone has it installed, and getting it via
``apt`` requires sudo privileges. Meanwhile xdev can be installed in user space
via pip, so this provides me with an easy way to get ``tree`` on someone's
system while helping them debug.

Other examples are ``sed``, ``find``, ``pyfile``, and ``pyversion``. Look at
the ``--help`` for more info on them.

The ``dirstats`` function is like a buffed up ``tree``. In addition to printing
the directory tree structure it inspects the contents of the tree and
summarizes things like: number of lines per type of file. For Python files it
breaks up the analysis into code-lines and docstring lines to give a better
sense of project complexity.


For repo maintence I use this package in conjunction with `xcookie
<https://github.com/Erotemic/xcookie>`_. I use xcookie to generate the package
structure and then xdev helps fill in the details. Specifically the
``availpkg`` and ``docstubs`` commands.


The ``availpkg`` command has been indispensable for me when writing
requirements.txt files. If you need to find good versions of a package ---
especially a binary one, e.g. numpy --- for different versions of Python and
would like the appropirate requirements.txt syntax to be generated for you,
take a look at ``availpkg``. It also provides an overview of what versions of a
package are available for what operating systems / CPU architectures.


The ``docstubs`` command is designed to turn google-style docstrings into
proper type annotation stubs.  It "works on my machine" and currently requires
a custom monkey patched mypy. See the code for details, it is possible to use,
but it is still very raw. I do think it can evolve into a tool.
